# Start Polymer 3.0 with TypeScript

This is just an adaptation of the start project for Polymer 3.0 with support for TypeScript, and it is shamelessly adapted from [here](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/start-polymer3).  Use this to get a feel for TypeScript Decorators for Polymer, and the basic `tsconfig.json`.

Please use the latest version of Chrome or Safari to view the app. It uses native [dynamic imports](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-import).  Also, use [lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) plugin for VS Code to get some nice syntax highlighting on template blocks.

```
npm install -g polymer-cli
git clone https://github.com/twitchax/start-polymer3-typescript.git
cd start-polymer3-typescript
npm install
npm start
```
